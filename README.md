# Partial-Dependent-Plots-Individual-Conditional-Expectation-Plots

Python code snippets to perform the following task:

1. Modeling
Training a simple Linear Regression model
Training an advanced Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) Regression model
Evaluating both models and comparing them on the Validation Root Mean Squared Error metric.

2. Partial Dependence Plots
Generating the following PDPs (for both models):
a) For predictor/feature "Mfg_Year", which is indicative to the 'Age' of a vehicle.
b) For predictor/feature "HP", which is indicative to the (horse) power of vehicle's engine. 
c) For predictor/feature "KM", it indicates vehicle's (accumulated) Kilometers on odometer

3. Individual Conditional Expectation Plots
Generating ICE Plots (for both models) on the same predictors as above. The ICE Plots generated for 10 unique points.
